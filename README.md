# Text Classification with Deep Learning
The dataset contains description of a product along with the Title of the verbatim. We have the correspondin
category to which the record has been classified

There are 55 unique categgories from which the classification is required to be done

We go through a series of steps to build a very compact Text Classification Model
The initial models are going to be very simple in structure
We crank up the performance using some cool Deep Learning methods towards the end

The final model gives an accuracy of 83.73% on the test set(328384 records)
